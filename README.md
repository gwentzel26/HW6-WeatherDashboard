For this project I wanted to create a weather dashboard showcasing the current weather and a five day forecast for a city that the user decides to search.  It will display temperature, uv index, windspeed, and humidity.  I will also save the recent searches into a search history section using local storage.  This project took a lot of patience and practice using for loops, api data fetching and filtering, local storage manipulation, and styling.
