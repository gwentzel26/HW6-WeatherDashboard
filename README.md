## **Description (Motivation? The why? Solved Problems?)**
      
  Weather Dashboard is a javacript application that uses data from a Weather API to display the current weather and five day forecast for the user's requested city.  After the user searches for a location anywhere in the world, the dashboard will return the temperature, uv index, windspeed, and humidity for the city.  It will also save recent searches in a search history section using local storage.
